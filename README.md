# Fitness Madness

Welcome to the readme file of my project.

## Introduction

Fitness Madness is a fitness website that encourages the user to become more fit.

The website offers the user the ability to buy gym passes that is valid in six gyms across Dublin city. (This is done solely for the project, Fitness Madness is not an actual gym in Ireland.) The website also offers the ability to record and share their progress with other users as well as buying sports products and meal plans as well as viewing other people's progresses and thoughts on products that the website offers.

You can find a link to my website [here](https://fitness11.herokuapp.com/).

## 1.3 User Stories

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Throughout the project, I used github user stories to record and keep track of my tasks. At the beginning, I listed all the things I needed to do, moved them to the second column when I am working on them and finally to the last column when I am done with that task.

## 1.4 Wireframes

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This was what I had in mind when I was coming up with the skeleton of the project.

This is what the index page should look like:

This is what the about page should look like:
![user_story_board](assets/wireframe/template-about-page.png)

This is what the product page should look like:
![user_story_board](assets/wireframe/template-product-page.png)

This is what the product-detail page should look like:

# 2. Features

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## 2.1 Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is placed at the top of all pages. The navigation bar is dynamic in that meaning depending on if the user is logged in or not the options will change.
- 

On a tablet or a phone, the navbar would look like this.

![navbar_mob](documents/images/mobile-1.png)

## 2.2 Login, Signup and Logout

The login function would allow the user to signin if the user already has an account.

![login](documents/images/webpage-signin.png)

If the user doesn't have an account, then s/he can sign up for one.

![signup](documents/images/webpage-signup.png)

And when a user wants to logout of their account, they can use the logout function.

![logout](documents/images/webpage-signout.png)

If the email or password is incorrect when signing in, the following would appear.
